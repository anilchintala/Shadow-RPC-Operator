UPDATE: Alpha Shadow Node testing is still ongoing

Connecting to our network currently involves three steps:

1) Submitting your RPC Server IP address to our performance-auditor for pass/fail assessment. Please reach out to a team member at GenesysGo for intructions.

2) After audit is passed, submission into the global traffic engine.

3) Verifying connection to health check bots in SSC DAO discord channel and confirming calls are properly serving.
